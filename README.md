A2ZDietPartner:

An application with ionic framework that uses the Edamam API with search algorithm to return most relevant diet plan as per user requirement and HealthFinder API that gives information from multiple agencies within US department including Center for disease control adn prevention, NIH and FDA for drug selection purpose. 

After successful registration and login, the application displays diet plan as per users choice like gluten-free etc. The user can also choose the health issue they are suffering with like diabetes and appropriate recommendations with respective links will be displayed. The user can also choose the side effects that they have encountered in their medical history which will return the chemicals to be avoided in their future prescriptions. 

The data is accessed/retrievd from API's and firebase database.

Future Scope:

We will make the application more dynamic and more user friendly with added features.
